= Those wanting to translate this plugin, please do. =

I believe the plugin is in a translatable state and I'll do everything I can to help in translation. It should be relatively quick as there isn't much text to the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. After installation, go *Settings > Background Music Menu* and configure your plugin
2. Background music menu should appear as an option in the *Appearance > Menus* section of the admin area upon activation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: What music formats does it support? =

A:  Format	MIME-type
	MP3	audio/mpeg
	Ogg	audio/ogg
	Wav	audio/wav

= Q: Why can not I upload a song file to my site? =

A: This is due to two reasons:
1. The ability to upload a file to your service is a big threat.
2. Because of the optimization of your resource. Any video and audio create a high load on your resource.

If you want to still use the file from your server, you can upload it via ftp. After that, insert the direct path to your file in the plugin's settings.
